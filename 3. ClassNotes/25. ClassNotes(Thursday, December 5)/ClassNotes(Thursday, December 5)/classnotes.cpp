	//Heaps
	//	 a heap is a complete binary tree that is either empty and root contains a value thats greater than each of its children and had heaps as subtrees
	//	left/right is not specified
	//
	//heap by default is maxheap can also be a minheap 
	//removing from a heap
	//	if we remove a  parent node we have a disjoint heap
	//	then we heapify the disjoint heaps
	//  
	//if you know maximum number of items in priority queue heap is better
	//
	//selection sort with unsorted portion being reheaped

	//What is a heap
	//	must be a complete binary tree
	//	for each node value must be greater than children
	//

	//REVIEW
	//pre prints all the way left then all the way right acending then back down left when reaches head
	//post prints left of node right of node then node and keeps going
	//in order left all the way down print node then print node and print right and keep going recursively
	//
