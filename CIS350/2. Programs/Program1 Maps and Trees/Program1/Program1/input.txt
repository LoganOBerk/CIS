put 2 9
put 9 -2

# Ensure expected output is shown
size                    # Expect a nonzero number
print_stats_tree        # Should show stats for inserted nodes

# Edge Case: Deleting a node that exists
erase 3

# Edge Case: Deleting a node that was already removed
erase 3                # No output expected, but should not crash

# Edge Case: Min/Max does not update correctly
put 7 -10              # Should update min if necessary
size                   # Should still match expected node count

# Edge Case: Deleting a node and checking that tree structure remains valid
erase 7
print_stats_tree       # Should update stats

# Edge Case: Reinserting deleted node
put 3 1
print_stats_tree       # Should reintroduce 3 with correct values

# Edge Case: Finding existing and missing keys
find 2                 # Should return the node, otherwise something is wrong
find 5                 # Should fail (5 was never inserted)

# Edge Case: Stats for missing key (should indicate key is missing)
print_key_stats 4      # Expect message that key is not found

# Edge Case: Stats for key that was erased
print_key_stats 7      # Should not exist after `erase 7`

# Final integrity checks
print                  # Ensure entire tree is displayed
print_stats            # Check global tree stats
print_tree             # Verify structure
